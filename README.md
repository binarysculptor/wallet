# Liberty

Liberty Coin, LLC, is a truly unique cryptocurrency and being a legally recognized business in the United States is only the tip of this veritable iceberg. That said, before going into our awesomeness, let's talk about history for a moment: After our initial launch in June of 2018, it became almost immediately obvious that we had missed the mark and failed to deliver a whitepaper and vision that captivated our target audience. The following weeks on exchange were nothing short of abysmal and thus, we knew  that a "redo" was in order. After copious time invested in research and development, a decision was made to move forward with a privacy coin that would protect the anonymity of Liberty citizens. To that same end, we have also been working diligently on an iOS app that should be ready for Apple Store submission within a matter of weeks. Our goal at Liberty Coin is to make crypto-commerce so easy your Grandma can do it and also enable powerful features that make it suitable for for point-of-sale transactions (even when they don't know each other and desire to keep their true identities secret).

Premine Allocation
=======================

The premine for Liberty coin (XLIB) was 22.5 million coins.

The previous generation of Liberty Coin (LBRT) ended at block 242,943. At that block there was approximately 1.7 million coins in circulation. The new generation of Liberty Coin offered at 1 LBRT -> 10 XLIB swap to the new chain.

LBRT Coins | XLIB Coins | Premine Remainder
---------- | ------------ | ---------------
1,700,000 | 17,000,000 | 22.5M - 17M = 5.5M XLIB

Thus, if every single owner of LBRT coins claimed their XLIB coins before the December 15, 2018 deadline, there would be be a balance of 5.5 million coins. Instead of burning these coins, however, the Liberty Coin team will offer an additional, limited-supply aidrop to all Bitcoin HODLers that have at least 1 BTC in their  account at a snapshot block to be announced. why would we do this? Simple! We want the world to know about Liberty Coin and how much more it brings to the table! This will be a first come, first serve registration airdrop and we'll announce more details AFTER we have completed the initial swap process for our LBRT -> XLIB transition. In the meantime, saavy investors can purchse XLIB coins from [CryptoBridge](https://wallet.crypto-bridge.org/market/BRIDGE.XLIB_BRIDGE.BTC), the only offical exchange for Liberty Coin, LLC.
